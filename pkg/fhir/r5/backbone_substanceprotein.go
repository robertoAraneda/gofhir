// SubstanceProteinSubunit represents the SubstanceProtein.subunit backbone element.
// This subclause refers to the description of each subunit constituting the SubstanceProtein. A subunit is a linear sequence of amino acids linked through peptide bonds. The Subunit information shall be provided when the finished SubstanceProtein is a complex of multiple sequences; subunits are not used to delineate domains within a single sequence. Subunits are listed in order of decreasing length; sequences of the same length will be ordered by decreasing molecular weight; subunits that have identical sequences will be repeated multiple times

	// The sequence information shall be provided enumerating the amino acids from N- to C-terminal end using standard single-letter amino acid codes. Uppercase shall be used for L-amino acids and lowercase for D-amino acids. Transcribed SubstanceProteins will always be described using the translated sequence; for synthetic peptide containing amino acids that are not represented with a single letter code an X should be used within the sequence. The modified amino acids will be distinguished by their position in the sequence
